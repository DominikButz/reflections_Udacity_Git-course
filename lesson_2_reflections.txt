What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

empty repository is created.  needed because version tracking happens in .git folder. this
folder is created with git init


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

not a folder. possible to fine-tune commits and select single files before actually committing.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
add single files and compare working dir with staging area using git diff.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
try out some experimental features on a different branch. 

--------
compare two branches with all commits (with diagram):
 git log --graph master coins
--------
create new branch:
git branch branch_name
switch to new branch:
git checkout branch_name
--------

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
 git log --graph branch1 branch2
 
 What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
 new version of the master branch including changes of both branches. 
 
 What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
 merging is only truly automatic if there are no conflicts... better share the work in a way that
 conflicts cannot or only rarely occur. E.g. one contributor works on a new class (of the model) whereas the other works on 
 the UI. afterwards, calling the new class and updating the ui should be done by only one programmer (e.g. after merging)
