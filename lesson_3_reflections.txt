When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When sharing code with others and let the community improve the code by adding new branches.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
maybe I work on a different branch and don't need the update immediately
