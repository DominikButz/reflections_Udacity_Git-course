When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When sharing code with others and let the community improve the code by adding new branches.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
maybe I work on a different branch and don't need the update immediately

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
Branch: history of one project version (involving 1 or several files). 
Clone: local copy of a repository (including branches)
Fork: Server copy of a repository - copying a repository from one git hub account to another
