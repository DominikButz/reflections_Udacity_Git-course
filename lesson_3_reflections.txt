When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When sharing code with others and let the community improve the code by adding new branches.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
maybe I work on a different branch and don't need the update immediately

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
Branch: history of one project version (involving 1 or several files). 
Clone: local copy of a repository (including branches)
Fork: Server copy of a repository - copying a repository from one git hub account to another

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
can check out the functionality before deciding to merge. git fetch and then if all ok : 
git merge A  B  .  same effect: git pull

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
harder: can't go back to earlier versions (only by using a file server like dropbox or Syno Cloud Station).
creating branches would be harder: can work with folders and alternative file names...

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?
If changes are beta, the code in the main branch still works as before. gives collaborators
a chance to suggest changes, all leaving the master branch on github untouched.
